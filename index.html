                                <p>"Hello, my name is John Patrick Hartley. I was born on June 10th, 2001, in sunny San Diego, California. I have a passion for gaming and love spending my free time watching YouTube and diving into strategy and fighting games. Whether I'm exploring complex tactics in strategy titles or sharpening my reflexes in intense fighting games, I enjoy the challenges and excitement they bring. My love for games has also inspired me to pursue a deeper understanding of game development and programming, turning my hobby into a pathway toward a creative and dynamic career. I'm looking for a role that offers opportunities for growth—both in my technical skills and career path—where I can continue to learn and take on new challenges. I want to work in an environment that encourages innovation and development, allowing me to expand my knowledge while making a meaningful impact."</p>

                                <h3 class="major">Astreya - 2.5D retro game </h3>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/astreyavid.gif" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>Astreya is my most recent project, developed over the course of a month with a team of three other people. Our goal was to create a game from scratch using Vulkan and the Gateware API. I was primarily responsible for designing the enemies and implementing the sound, which was a rewarding challenge as it marked my first successful audio integration in a project. Additionally, this project was my first experience using Blender to create 3D models, which I used to bring the enemies to life. Beyond those areas, I also contributed to other aspects of development, such as gameplay mechanics and testing, making it a well-rounded learning experience. Inspired by Asteroids, we set out to recreate the classic game by the second week of class before expanding on it with our own innovations. This experience taught me a lot about real teamwork, further honed my programming skills, and gave me confidence in tackling new tools like Blender. The hard work paid off, as our professor recognized Astreya as one of the best projects the class had ever seen. It will now be used as the example project for future students, which makes it even more rewarding.</p>
                                    
                                <h3 class="major">Robocode - AI robot dueling</h3>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/ROBOVID.gif" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>Robocode was a project from my Artificial Intelligence class, where the goal was to build a robot capable of defeating the school's own AI opponent. Since I genuinely loved both the class and AI as a subject, I dedicated a lot of time and effort to refining my robot's strategy. I implemented a sophisticated <span>targeting</span> system, calculating enemy positions based on their velocity and heading, and even incorporated battlefield boundary checks to ensure accuracy <button class="small" onclick="toggleSnippet('targeting-snippet')">View Targeting Logic</button>. The robot also features a <span>radar-locking</span> mechanism to maintain focus on the closest enemy <button class="small" onclick="toggleSnippet('radar-locking-snippet')">View Radar Focus</button>, paired with <span>dynamic bullet power</span> adjustments based on distance—maximizing efficiency while conserving energy <button class="small" onclick="toggleSnippet('bullet-power-snippet')">View Power Efficiency</button>. The competitive aspect made it even more exciting, as I was driven not just to complete the assignment but to showcase my work and test it against other students' creations. It was a rewarding experience that fueled my passion for AI and strategic problem-solving.</p>

                                <p>StoneHenge was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging assignments I've faced in my degree program. Given to me during my graphics class, it demanded a significant amount of dedication and effort to complete. More than any other class, this project deepened my understanding of lighting and textures, pushing me to refine my skills and problem-solving abilities. Despite the difficulty, it was an incredibly valuable learning experience—one that tested my limits and helped me grow as a developer.</p>
                                
                                <h3 class="major">Take A Chance - Unity FPS </h3>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/TAKEAVID.gif" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>Take A Chance was my first real attempt at making a game, developed alongside a classmate as part of a two-month-long midterm project. It was our introduction to Unity, as well as our first experience using Scrum and Trello to organize tasks and communicate progress effectively. The assignment came with specific requirements, such as implementing audio support, which pushed us to learn and apply new skills throughout development. We created an impressive feature set, including a working Risk of Rain item system, varying functioning enemy types, multiple levels, and a challenging boss fight with the boss featuring different attacks. More than just a school project, this experience was a significant milestone for me. It marked the moment when game development became more than just an interest—it became something tangible that I could build and bring to life. Looking back, Take A Chance remains one of my most memorable and rewarding experiences in school, and it will always hold a special place in my heart, especially considering that for a two-person team new to Unity, this was a pretty impressive accomplishment.</p>
